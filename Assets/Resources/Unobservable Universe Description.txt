Anything beyond the particle horizon can never be communicated or observed by us as light beyond that point will never reach the Earth. If an alien civilisation were to exist outside of the observable universe, we would never be able to communicate with them, and would never learn of each others existence. Estimates for how large the unobserved universe is ranges from millions of times larger than the observable universe to inifinitely large. The universe is so vast that we as humans are unable to comprehend the scale of it, and will theoretically never be able to fully explore and map out every part of the observable universe, much less beyond that.
