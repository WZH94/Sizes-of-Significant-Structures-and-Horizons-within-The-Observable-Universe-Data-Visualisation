Observable Universe (Particle Horizon),93000,"The observable universe comprises all matter that can be observed from the Earth. This is derived from the particle horizon, which is the maximum distance that light could have travelled to an observer in the entire age of the universe. Everything that we know of exists within the observable universe, including our home, Earth, and anything outside of the observable universe is unknown. Due to the expansion of the universe, the sizes of the observable universe and the horizons within it are expanding over time as well."
Cosmic Event Horizon,32000,"The cosmic event horizon represents the boundary inside which, if light was emitted now, may still reach us in the future, unlike the particle horizon which also accounts for light emmited in the past. Light emitted outside of this horizon now will never reach Earth due to the constant expansion of the universe. This is a real event horizon which affects every kind of signals that travel at the speed of light."
Hubble Horizon,26744,"The hubble horizon is a conceptual horizon defining the conceptual boundary between particles that are moving slower or faster than the speed of light relative to an observer at a given time. That is, particles seperated by a distance greater than the Hubble radius are unable to communicate to each other as they are now. This is contrasted with particles outside of each other's particle horizon, in which case, they could never have communicated. However, depending on the expansion of the universe, these particles may be able to communicate in the future."
Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall,1000,"The largest known structure in the observable universe, the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall is an unusually high concetrated volume of gamma-ray burts (GRB), which is typically emitted during a supernova. For this reason, this structure is often called The Great GRB Wall. The Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall contains many billions of galaxies, but the Milky Way is not a part of it, and is about 9 to 10 billion light years away from Earth."
Laniakea Supercluster,500,"Discovered in 2014 and named in Haiwaiian with the meaning ''immense heaven''', the Laniakea supercluster is home to the Milky Way and approximately 100,000 other galaxies. The Laniakea supercluster consists of four subparts, which were previously identified as seperate superclusters, of which one is the Virgo supercluster, which is also where the Milky Way resides in. Studies have suggested that this supercluster is not gravitationally bound, and will disperse over time rather than maintain its current structure and is proposed to be the basin of the mysterious Great Attractor."
Virgo Supercluster,100,"Initially believed to be the largest superstructure that the Milky Way is a part of before the discovery of the Laniakea supercluster in 2014, the Virgo supercluster contains at least 100 galaxy groups and clusters.  The Virgo supercluster is one of approximately 10 million other superclusters known to us within the observable universe."
Local Group,10,"The Local Group is the galaxy group that contains the Milky Way, as well as the Andromeda galaxy, which are the two most massive galaxies of the Local Group. The Local Group is largely seperated into two clusters of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, with each galaxy containing a collection of satellite galaxies surrounding them. The Local Group lies on the outskirts of the Virgo supercluster and has a gravitational center which lies somewhere between the Milky Way galaxy and the Andomeda galaxy."
Milky Way,1.9,"The Milky Way is home to our Solar System and planet Earth and was initially believed to contain all the stars in the Universe. Visible from Earth in our night skies, it is the most identifiable galaxy to us with its signature spiral pattern. A fun fact is that almost every science fiction universe occurs only within the Milky Way, which means that even with all the advanced technology imaginable to us, the rest of the Universe outside of the relatively tiny Milky Way is usually unexplored. The Solar System is so tiny compared to the Milky Way (0.0000000304 million light years across) that it is not visible in this visualisation even though it exists within the program."
